Celebrity Crunch Game 

Celebrity crunch is a game built with apple's SpriteKit framework. It's basically a guessing game centered around movies and the actors that play in them. The panel shows a random movie and you have to select the actor in the grid that plays in it. When you select the right actor, the sprite disappears and is replaced by a new actor. The game is designed in a way in which at least one actor playing in the displayed movie is included in the grid of actors. You can also shuffle actors until you find one that you think plays in the movie. Skipping an unfamiliar movie is done by just tapping on the movie panel. See video demonstration below.
